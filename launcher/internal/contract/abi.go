// Package contract is the fossil layer: the frozen handshake vocabulary and the
// JSON document schemas that any-age launcher and any-age Electron payload agree
// on. Changing anything here is a reseed (installer), not a seamless update.
// Every other package is mechanism layered on top of these definitions.
//
// This is the Open Design port of the Go launcher PoC, adapted to OD's decisions
// (see .task/MAIN.md). The load-bearing divergences from the PoC:
//
//   - The launcher is NETWORK-FREE: it never downloads. New payloads and new
//     launcher binaries are fetched by the Electron payload's updater and arrive
//     on disk; the launcher only selects, spawns, supervises, and rolls back.
//   - The launcher spawns exactly ONE child — Electron — and is blind to whatever
//     Electron spawns below it (daemon/web). Coupling is loose, by convention.
//   - Boot health is heartbeat-during-boot (no fixed ReadyGrace): OD's daemon can
//     take ~35s normally and up to ~30min under legacy-data migration, so the
//     launcher acts only on a MISSED heartbeat or a process exit.
